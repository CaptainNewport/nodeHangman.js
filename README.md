Okay once again the code is incomplete, variables are missing but the skeleton is there I think. The main thing I didn't get a variable for 
a win necessarily, but I imagined I did.

In a nutshell the game should take a random string from an array, pass it through to a result function which should have some true or false 
boolean to identify progress and eventual completion of the guesses. There is a variable for tries. 


Also again everything is broken and I'm also getting an error in the main playGame function for punctuation, this is again due to my 
work ethic, you guys have been great to me so far.
